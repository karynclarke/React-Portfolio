                        I am a UofO Coding Bootcamp student, learning Full Stack Development at an accelerated pace. My Portfolio shows a variety of homework assignments done in class and a group assigment.

                         When I am not coding, I use my creative and technical abilities daily in my career as TV Newscast Director.  I am looking for an opportunity to utilize my experience working with teams, adapting to changing environments,
                        and learning new technologies.</p>
